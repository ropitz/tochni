      <p>Unofficial, temp internal site for sharing the TL scans showing coastal erosion from 2011 to 2015. Scans may be viewed <a href="http://ropitz.github.io/tochni/tochni_coast.html">here</a>.</p>
      <p>The viewer contains individual scans for the towers in each year (2011, 2012, 2015), which were used for georeferencing. It also contains individual scans for the coastal area, with a different color for each year. Finally there are scans for the coastal area that are colored by distance from the original scan. Use the 'scenes' section of the menu to toggle the visibility of individual scans.</p>
      <p>Scanning was carried out by staff from CAST, University of Arkansas. The work was supported by the KAMBE project, led by Kevin Fisher and Sturt Manning.</p>
